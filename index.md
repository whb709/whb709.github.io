# About Me

Here is **Hongbin Wang** [(王鸿斌)](https://github.com/whb709).<br>

I am a undergraduate student in the **PELLab** at the Shenzhen University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by **[Prof. Qihua Zhou]**(https://qihuazhou.github.io/). Even if I am a first-year underguaduate student, I am passionate about research.

I have always been willing to participate in academic discussions or make many wise friends. Please feel free to reach out to me at **2025150124@mails.szu.edu.cn**. I sincerely look forward to brainstorming with you.
