# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Hongbin Wang** [(王鸿斌)](https://github.com/whb709).<br>

I am a undergraduate student in the [school of CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/) at the Shenzhen University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Qihua Zhou](https://qihuazhou.github.io/). Even if I am a first-year underguaduate student, I am passionate about the research.

I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out to me at **2025150124 [at] mails.szu.edu.cn**. I sincerely look forward to brainstorming with you.
